# Avian-Armageddon-SDL2
Made originally as a final project for CPSC 4160 - 2D Game Engine Construction at Clemson University. Main purpose was to improve my ability architecture large scale programs and have a little fun making a simple game

Written in C++ and uses the SDL library to render sprites, text, and play audio.
